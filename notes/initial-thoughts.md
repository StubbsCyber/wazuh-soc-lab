- What is confusing?
- What did you validate today?
- What will you test next?

- I was able to confirm dashbaord and indexer services are running normal. Backend helath validated prior to agent and alert verification
- All Wazuh services are opertaional at this time.

- Confirmed Wazuh detection of repeated Windows logon failures (Event ID 4625). Alerts were reviewed and correlated with local Event Viewer data, validating end-to-end log ingestion and detection capability.
